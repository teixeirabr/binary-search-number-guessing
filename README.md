This game demonstrates a classic programming algorithm: binary search. When tasked with finding a number within a range using binary search, the computer will always guess in the middle of the range. By using this algorithm, it will find your number in 7 or less tries every time (for 100 numbers) -- a vast performance improvement over a random or sequential search.
